# RTutorials
I float between several different computers but I have some downtimes with those machines. I want to get better at taking advantage of those times so I'm putting my folders of practice code here.

So, this repo is to hold my Rust cargo projects as I'm learning about Rust. My main source of information is the main [Rust Programming language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).
